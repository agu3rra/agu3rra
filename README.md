# Andre Guerra: Backend Developer and Technical Lead at ExxonMobil
Interested in building a career in the area of software development with a strong focus on security and automation. Solid experience working in a global environment supporting high complexity IT systems.

I'm a perpetual learner, passionate about technology, languages and all forms of intelligence. I've seeked to apply programming solutions into all work experiences I've had thus far and it is by far what I like to do best. Python is my primary programming language and what I like most about it is the huge community and how it allows one to focus on solving problems without much concern to the programatic part of them. There is such an infinite number of libraries/packages that cover plenty areas of science, math and engineering.
