# About me
I'm a **security engineer**, passionate about software development, with a strong focus on **security and automation**. I've solid experience working in global and diverse environments supporting high-complexity IT systems.

Programmatically solving problems is what I like to do best. **Python** is my primary language of choice, and I'm a fan of its community and how it allows one to solve complex problems quickly. I've recently been drawn to **Rust** and started to enjoy programming in the company of its famous compiler and ecosystem.
