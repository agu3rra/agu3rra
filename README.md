# About me
Interested in building a career in the area of software development with a strong focus on security and automation. Solid experience working in a global environment supporting high complexity IT systems.

I'm a perpetual learner passionate about technology. I've sought to apply programming solutions into all work experiences I've had thus far and it is what I like to do best. Python is my primary language of choice and what I like most about it is its huge community and how it allows one to solve problems in a very straightforward fashion.

* Container based solutions: Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift.
* Applied cryptography: SSL setup and in-app.
* Open-source security and licensing compliance.
