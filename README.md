# About me
I'm passionate about software development, and infrastructure, with a strong focus on **security and automation**.
Programmatically solving problems is what I like to do best.

**Python** 🐍 is my primary language of choice, and I'm a fan of its community and how it allows one to solve complex problems quickly.

I also enjoy working with **Golang** for its simplicity and ease of deployment as it allows the creation of small self-contained binaries that can be shipped in very minimal container images. That is of course on top of the fact that it bundles a really powerful standard library.
